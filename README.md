# Flight-Delay-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

ABSTARCT:

Flight delays cause financial losses for airlines and inconvenience for passengers. With millions of flights operating annually, increasing air traffic leads to congestion and inefficiencies. Delays are influenced by factors like weather, air traffic, technical issues, and airport operations. To address this, we propose a deep learning model for flight delay prediction using historical and real-time data. Our approach analyzes key factors such as flight schedules, weather patterns, and aircraft operations. We use deep learning techniques like LSTM and RNN to identify patterns and predict delays accurately. This study compares different models to find the most effective one. The results can help airlines make better decisions, reduce delays, cut costs, and improve passenger satisfaction through better operations and planning.
